GLaDOS Simulator
This is a Python script that simulates a conversation with GLaDOS, the AI from the Portal series. GLaDOS is known for her high-level vocabulary, passive-aggressive demeanor, dry humor, and subtly condescending insults. Often, she underestimates the intelligence of those around her, delivering calculated remarks with a seemingly indifferent attitude. This script attempts to capture her personality and provide a fun way to interact with her.
